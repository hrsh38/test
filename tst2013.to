Hello. Srry i don't remember saying two faced but I did say I started feeling a little uncomfortable talking to you and telling you things
No this has nothing to do with me and nihar. I've actually brought this up to nihar when we were together second semester fresh year.
I started feeling like this bc I saw you'd give me looks whenever I said something to you or did. I thought you were thinking things and just judging so I got uncomfortable and then got harder to talk to you. Nihar said it was just the way you are. and that's completely fine Alsoo this summer you'd start a convo and wouldn't reply to me for few days, which I didn't get idk. I thought you weren't that interested in talking
You don't need to say sorry please!! I'm sorry I didn't know you were going through things and I'm sorry for not coming to you first and just telling you how I felt. I tend to distance myself from the person when this stuff happens. But I should've just told you
Yea no that wasn't the reason
Why are you still up so late
Couldn't fall asleep So was just on my phone
