These are two different worlds
Very different
Bruh I've barely spoken any English in the past week
We boutta pick up an accent It'll be me and Kush
So when are we starting to drink
LOLOL I feel like I'm.boutta crash during the actual cruise
Wait why And cuz of the alcohol and jet lag
But where we gonna sleep in miami We gotta lug everything around Till 5
Damn wtf If I touch alcohol while sleep deprived that's the only time I'll have problems Last time I did that I was whiling in an NYC rave in the bathroom
Just sleep early on Sunday
So u wake up nice and refreshed on Monday morning
Drink the night before LOL
Damn we really gonna go hard for 5 days Jk only hard for 2 days tops
LOLL BRO what That's impressive I haven't drank in 2 weeks so far That'll prolly reset my tolerance I think
Holy shit That's good Damn ya you're pretty far in ur drinking career Avi prolly at your lebel
Bro the acid reflux shit started recently for me this semester Like wtf Now it's fine but it was so bad at the end of the semester
And ya basically
Idt I'll drink too too much on the cruise though
Holy shit what
Sheittt
It started when I drank a really strong one on an empty stomach Like I was DRUNK off one shot
Ya I think now you might be fine At least for a week Don't go too too hard for the cruise I guess
HAHA just a week I got hella meds after that one night for acid reflux LOL Temporary solution
Not gonna use it unless I need to for kushs Birthday
I have no clue, my brother gave it cu, he gets this shit
Otc ofc There's one that takes affect after a couple days
JK this might be prescription but we get it from India so u don't really need a prescription He knows this shit better than anyone
Ooo IDT mine is that bad. Honestly even Tums just nullify
Wait but what u gonna do if u get it
But we gonna be drinking everyday
Ohh
Ayu that's good Bro recently after gyming I feel so much healthier
I haven't been to the gym in a bit though. I lost all the good gains
Finals week and India ð¤ð¤ College Ave gym It's a walk
Ya it's nice Who do u think gonna drink the most on the cruise
I'm down
But I think it's gonna be me, nikul Sam or avi
LOL
That's also a maybe Me and nkkul have out drank Sam before
But this dude Is a tank
Dude ya he goes wild but nothing much happens to him Cuz he started recently Fucking free year's
Avi got control recently But also it's the cruise so he might Go back to the old days
Nah not anymore He did over the summer
I can't believe he went vegetarian though
I can for months at a time but I always start to crave it I haven't eaten meat in like 2 weeks
India I'm also vegetarian when I go home cuz parents don't know
They not with it I grew up vegetarian
LOL ya basically
But the food here
I'll take u one day It's the best food I might be biased cuz I grew up here but fuck I crave this shit back in America
LOL American food Burgers is the only thing That's American There's a bunch of shit that I don't know how to spell
French fries ð¤ð¤ð¤
Why not :( JK there's many reasons
I love india Well my part of India Gujarat Everywhere else feels not so safe
Nah meat ain't banned New generation  all drinks It's gonna change soon
Yep that all sucks honestly Oh shit
I like the calmess here though I love that part It's a refresher to me Every trip I take here I reset
Gotchy U know how you feel after getting really good sleep It's like that times a 100 All the stress and bullshit from America is gone And puts a lot of things into perspective Like all my problems there If that makes sense
Ya exactly Sometimes feels like we just make up our own problems in our heads

It's good But like I'm still looking You know
It depends on what I wanna do Tbh I'm still figuring it out After college ððð But I guess better late than never Sorry my signal.is not the best rn
Next week I got an interview for something
I want to Eventually
Dude I feel weird rn
I had a lot of conversations tonight with people and like their aspirations And like I wanna grow my aspirations And grow myself Idk I feel a huge push LOOOL sorry, this shit prolly came outta nowhere for you
I went to a grad party tonight and by the end of it everyone was like having heart to hearts and stuff
And then it got me REALLY thinking
Idk I feel behind though if that makes sense
Like I graduated college and I'm figuring this stuff out rn Yahhh that's true But now like I want a job I've never wanted a job before in my life I hated working and the thought of it
But now I want it like real bad
Yahhhh but you seem like you have your shit together and stuff Like uk where u wanna go I wanna get there
Yahhh I think I'm on the first step but I'm realizing now But like I feel like I truly won't know what I wanna do until I start working but like the paradox is I don't wanna do something that I don't enjoy So it makes no sense with my mentality rn cuz how will I ever know what I don't and do enjoy Idk I just realized that recently I was tryna aim for like a perfect job but idt that exists
Hey bro Yah I fell asleep that day Thanks for all the advice and stuff though
How's everything with you
OH SHIT that's exciting as fuck Forgot u were in Cali Always cali
Yah U did
