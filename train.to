Oh haha I was at my brother's place all weekend Yeah once I move in I'll be close to You guys [emoji] What did you add me to lol
Lmfao Who you want
Who you have?
Oh wait you have bell? Nah that's not good To trade a player of Bell's caliber You need a RB/wr 1 and an rb2/wr2 Lemme see your team
Nah I mean send me a screenshot
So you're tryna trade bell for 2 players? I should be looking at Nikuls team my bad lol
Lmao I want bell I could have the whole Steelers offense Bell and brown
You want Doug martin And McCaffery
Who you want Ooh I'll give you Fournette And McCaffery
Not tryna cheat you You down?
Accept it I sent it
You can't what?
Ohh
Accept it Tomorrow then
Yeee
Cuz week isn't over
Including in the deal?
Yeah me too lmao Do you wanna add it
Lmfao
Yeaaa
Loll I'll do iy
You know when teams trade players just to cut them for salary cap This is kind of like that
Lolol But actually I sent it
Why what?
Yeah hhaa
What they say
Cuz nikul asked for leveon
They would have seen it anyway
Nah you can't What did you trade ajit
What does that have to do with reversing?
Lmao did he wanna trade for bell
Oh okay What is? Trading
Lololol Yeah trading is exciitng Gets the blood flowing
Even if he stays the same Fournette is Killin it
Damn you rejected my trade offer
Nah you good I'm just kidding
What the nonsense did you just send me
Yeah I do I switch them in and out
Lolol you so desperate at tight end
You don't have a te
Ohh you have him?
Then why you tryna trade for a te Nah he's good
All tight ends sucks
Yeah but besdies them And kelce Everyone is inconsistent To be a top 10 tight end is not very tough
That's the issue
What's your offer
Smh Rishard Matthews is the closest thing To trade able for me
Lmao Why did you trade demaryius You can easily stream QBs based on matchups without an issue
Lmao It's a fair trade
The trade itself is fine It's just
It's easier to stream QBs and play them then it is to find WRs
Yeah it's fun but issue is after a few weeks everyone stops trying
LOL Over who Start lee Good sleeper Can indy
Nah Rishard matthws has a very good matchup If you wanna gamble Folwer is not a very good option Trevor Simean is nothing great Fowler is unproven I wouldn't if I was you The chances of him going off are slim
If you really want Fuck it Leonard fournette will save you
Lolol
Yo You know the best way to decide who to start
You Flip a coin.
Lolol I've definitely done it before Go Yo Gimme a qb
Qb Like Quarter back
Lolol Don't you have 2
Oh man You got that clown Who else do you have
I mean at qb
Lolol that would make more sense How's dak I want him I'll give you Mariota and some other asshole
Yeah Unfortunately Mariota ain't that bad He just had one bad game
He had 2 easy matchups Atlanta is low key good against qbs
Is that a joke New England has been the absolute worst defense in the league They gave up a 300 yard passer in every week before yesterday
Lmao Yeah that's why Chiefs shredded the pats remember Kareem hunt had 43 points Alex smith had like 5 TDs
Yep lol
Lmao
Nikul just asked me the same thinh
Lolol
Who are your other RBs And WRs
Yeahh I think it benefits your situation You can play kearse matchup base The difference between McCaffery and Coleman are very slight
McCaffery is better but not by much And it's likr What the fuck is a Bennie fowler Do you wanna come to my apartment tomorrow
New Brunswick
Lmao Address is 15 Chester circle, new Brunswick, nj Sanjay is coming Avi ajit bhavesh might be I asked everyone to come

Hahaha for sure We should all do something that night
Yeah word sounds good
Lmao isn't that normal
Why are you an idiot
Not stupid per se Depends who you're putting the tight ends you're putting over who
Richard is whatcer
I'd put ebron over him Bur Adams is gonna keep doing well He's productive
6.4 YPC or something
Jac
Jax
But more importantly than the YPc The work is there for adams He's getting more snaps He saw 22 carries last week The eagles are finally committing to him as the focal point in the backfield
He's by far the best running back on the team But between him and ebron I would play it by ear Week to week matchups Now that Doyle is out for the year Ebron is gonna keep blwoing up But Adams could too Ebron tore up Jax for 3 TDs last time they played
Hahah yes it is But Drake is super inconsist
I think adams is much safer
Haha risk would be drake But Adams is the safer pick
Hahah Word Hey buddy How's it goin
Good good You free Sunday?
Anytime Just to chill if youre fre
Damnn aight
Oh wow you need a big game from adams Nah you're far from fucked But it'll be tough for sure You just need his players not to blow up
Yeaaa First game
Yeah holy shit He ended with 45 right That's just so sad
Lmao Yeah for real It's playoffs right
Whaaaa That's so crazy How much did you put on In
Wow That's so sad Fucking amari cooper You free tomorrow? Wanna come to my SB house

Shiiit For how long
Sad I won't get to see you then
At least that's therw Can't wait Only 3 weeks away It slipped my mind these past months How's India
Lmaoo Yeah word When do you come back
Yikesss What time do you land
Oh woe Yeah you gotta sleep aall day Sunday hah
Sleep on the plane Stay up all night
Probably won't at all haha Not much of a gambler
Haha I mean you can use my shit if that's a thing
Oh lool If I have the same credit I'd be down to do that
Ay happy new year buddy! How goes the trip
Haha word what you been doin
Oh word nice haha Cousins? You got engaged Happy for you
Sad
Lmfaoooo You'll always be bachelor in my jwar Heart*
I can't wait for this cruise Hahahaha yeah wods
I'm so excited
Yeah hahah
Don't come back with a fob accent
Yo That's what I'm talking about
Lmaooo Patel brothers
Pregaming the Uber ride Duh
Haha why I might stay up Till the flight Not sure yet
I usually do that Nah you'll have fun with me So you'll be awake But I usually stay up till 3 when I have 6am flights cuz I be sleeping at 2 anyway lol
Na I don't sleep during the day If I knock out on the plane for an hour or 2 I should be fine
Lmfaooo Yikes Big yikes Idk I don't like to sleep only a few hours Then I wake up in deep sleep And I just can't operate
That's the thjng
Over winter break Ive been sleeping so late And waking up so late the past few days Going to sleep early is gonna be impossible
Loool Nah Gotta save my drinking My liver can only survive so much
I haven't drank in 2 months
Nah I've had to My liver Is going bad I had high ALT levels So my liver was inflamed or something I got it down now But I didnt wanna agitate it Before the cruise
Hahaha yeah I started much earlier than you guys I mean It wasn't too high I just started eating really healthy disnt drink And dieted Now I'm in a healthy range My acid reflux is also always a problen So to avoid all that I haven't been drinking I'm gonna eat so badly And drink so muvh When we go I've already put my concious to rest
Bro
It's the worst thing ever
I've had it for 3 years It never goes away
You just gotta control it with habits Why do you think I didn't drink most of those nights at senior Last year I don't wanna drink unnecessarily Like only Birthday and big events
Cuz too much drinking It'll keep agitating That's mostly why I haven't drank for 2 months I want my tolerance to alcohol to be better off
Your acid relfux? Shiiit
Nah I know how to control it It doesn't hurt while I drink it It's the next day for me The whole point of be not drinking for this long is so I can drink and eat liberally on the cruiee
What meds?
Ya word hahs
Is it otc or prescription Honestly meds aren't that effective, habits are much more important
Ohh
Yeah makes sense haha I use a prescription Not sure it actually helps
Ya mine has been bad at times I always just try to control habits
I'll pray ð¬ð¬ð¬ Nah it only comes the day after
Ya It only happens When I'm drinking more regularly Like every week or so
Yeaah So I'm in better shape overall
Yeah word losing weight helps a lot
Where you going to the gym
Lmaoo That's down the street
Ooh Can we place bets I think Avi
I think
Nobody is a crazy drinker
Oh wait Yeah definitely sam
Nah like He just let's himself get blitz
It's not as much about tolerance As willingness That's the real factor here
Ya exactly The person that will drink the most Needs to be willing to get blitz I see that as sam Or avi
And went vegetarian right...
Yeah haha I was kidding Ya I hope he does Honestly I feel like you'll be on the same wavelength as me with drinking
Yeah for real Kind of wild I don't think I could go vegetable for more than 2 days
Why so long
Wait really They don't know? Why didn't you tell them
Oh shi It's cuz they're patela Patels
Done be guju Don't* Come to the South side
But it's vegetables
Hahahah Ya of course What you been eating india Don't worry on the cruise we'll eat all American food You know Chinese food Tacos All the American food
Hey man Don't disrespect fries And sodium That's American
Im not a big fan of India honestly
Lmaooo Especially after living there I csnt
It's cuz They don't drink Or eat meat It's all banned Bunch of tools
Oh But most people Don't eat it Nah I mean The people for me Corruption People in india In international schools Just very stuck up
And growing up in America Personalities don't clash very well
And obviously different for you But I'm whatever about my family in India What do you mean reset
Ya definitely makes sense It's like bigger issues in India Makes ours seem insignificant
I don't think made up per se but I think it's just the society we live in dictating what's important
One sec lemme go upstairs and take a pic
Yup [emoji] I'm just bringing a duffle bag size
I mean You can bring up to 50 lbe I just don't wanna lug that around I've brought like India bags before

Yeah word
That would be cool Haha qhy Why Sudeep stopped sharing video.
Hahaha nah don't worry I'm always here to listen
But nah that's good you realize it now
Honestly aspirations will come whenever
Some people care more about job and everything in life more than others Makes senSe for sure
Honestly its fine people people figure out what they want to do at different tkmes Some people go 10 years and then change careers
I went 3 years then I changed my stuff right Yeah word and that's good
Haha but it took a while right It comes at different times Once you figure it out you're good It's just about what you want to do Honestly yeah first step is you realizing you want those sort of aspirations, then slowly they'll build up naturally, it's just whatver you're Passionate abour
Haha yeah but honestly that's most people, that's just the adventure that is life honestly, we go through things to see what we like cuz we don't truly know what we like till we do something And yeah honestly, perfect is just perspective right Whatever you feel is perfect, that's what it is You just go to what you think will enjoy and go from there It definitely sucks to do something what you don't like, but you can always take away something from any experience, there's always something to learn From every experience So don't let the thought get you down
No worries Bur yeah of course I'm always here for that
Good good, I. Came to San Jose Sunday Got rohith's wedding on Saturday
Haha I told you he's getting married right Always loll
This is the last summer I can fuck around and stay for a while
Yeah word exactly Have you put more thought into where you wnana work Or what you wanna do
